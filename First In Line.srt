1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:15,660
When they gave out eyes like diamonds

2
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:23,280
That would shame the stars that shine

3
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:31,540
My darling, my darling

4
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:38,940
You were the first in line

5
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:45,880
When they gave out lips like honey

6
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:54,000
That hold a new thrill every time

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,200
My darling, my darling

8
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:08,540
You were the first in line

9
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:17,400
There may be others that know you longer

10
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:24,140
Who pledge their hearts to you

11
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:33,260
But there's no other could love you stronger

12
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:39,860
Any stronger than I do

13
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:46,920
Don't refuse me, say you'll choose me

14
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:55,200
I'm yours, oh please be mine

15
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:02,660
My darling, say I'm your darling

16
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:09,680
The first and the last in line

17
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:18,340
There may be others that know you longer

18
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:25,280
Who pledge their hearts to you

19
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:34,080
But there's no other could love you stronger

20
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:40,860
Any stronger than I do

21
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:48,380
Don't refuse me, say you'll choose me

22
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:55,800
I'm yours, oh please be mine

23
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:03,860
My darling, say I'm your darling

24
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:17,840
The first and the last in line
