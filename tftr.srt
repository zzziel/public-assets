1
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:15,040
If you're feeling fancy free

2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,560
Come wander through the world with me

3
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,600
And any place we chance to be

4
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,920
Will be a rendezvous

5
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,980
Two for the road

6
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,060
We'll travel through the years

7
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:42,440
Collecting precious memories

8
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,880
Selecting souvenirs

9
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:53,400
And living life the way we please

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,780
In the summertime the sun will shine

11
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:04,300
In winter we will drink summer wine

12
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:09,520
And any day that you are mine

13
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,960
Will be a lovely day

14
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:21,700
As long as love still wears a smile

15
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:27,600
I know that we'll be two for the road

16
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:35,940
And that's a long, long while

17
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:05,460
As long as love still wears a smile

18
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:11,320
I know that we'll be two for the road

19
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:25,760
And that's a long, long while
