1
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,199
She stands by the lights at the front of the audience.

2
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:15,039
Smile on her face, just taking in their every glance

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,159
She loves the way they love her

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,419
She loves the way they love her

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,819
And she smiles

6
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,399
She loves every sweet talking lie

7
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,229
Then a smooth talking baby-faced man

8
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,380
from the management

9
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:46,039
Trips on the wire as he's paying her a compliment.

10
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,319
She loves the way he loves her

11
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,579
She loves the way he loves her

12
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,239
And she smiles

13
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,099
She loves every sweet talking lie

14
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,960
And she smiles

15
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,580
She loves every sweet talking lie

16
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,240
Crying, dying, sighing while she's shining in the microphone

17
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,960
Kings and Queens of future time when she and me are all alone

18
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:47,400
She loves the way I love her

19
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,480
And she smiles

20
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:53,420
She loves every sweet talking lie

21
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,600
Running my hands through her hair

22
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,040
And knowing she'll always be there

23
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:10,740
She loves the way they love her

24
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,280
She loves the way

25
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:18,680
She loves the way they love her

26
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:29,340
She smiles
