1
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:21,078
When you're thirsty and no one will fill your cup for you

2
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:29,679
And your well-dressed friends don't want you on their street

3
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:36,719
When you're so far down, the gutter looks like up to you

4
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:46,159
I will still be kneeling at your feet

5
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:52,359
I will still be kneeling at your feet

6
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:59,979
When you can't remember where you left your laughter

7
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:07,300
And you forget the definition of your name

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,020
When your yesterday sets fire to your ever after

9
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:29,580
I'll reach down and pull you from the flames

10
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:38,720
When all the crippled children you give strength to

11
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,960
Lay their crutches down and walk away

12
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:53,160
And you realize that all their mothers hate you

13
00:01:54,080 --> 00:02:08,480
I'll be there to hear the things you say

14
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:16,080
When at last your bitter problems all ignore you

15
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,840
And you've come out clean, everything is done

16
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:31,340
And you realize I've been through it all before you

17
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:45,680
Come down and walk beside me in the sun
