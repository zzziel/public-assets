1
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:20,640
You came smiling softly, shining moonbeam

2
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:27,500
Easy as a dreamer into my world

3
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,540
And before I realized the danger

4
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:41,680
I found myself staring into your eyes

5
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,420
Somewhere in their colors I saw promises

6
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:59,160
Of things I'd never seen before

7
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,100
It's all over

8
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:11,320
I've got to have you

9
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:19,160
Holding on to talk and saying nothing

10
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:25,060
Knowin' in a moment I could lose you

11
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,620
Then without a warning I remembered

12
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:40,140
That you trembled at the touch of my hand

13
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,760
Knowin' when you came to me that no one else

14
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,660
Would ever feel the same

15
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,520
In my arms

16
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:04,020
It's all over

17
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:12,060
I've got to have you

18
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:17,620
Waking in the morning with the tenderness

19
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:25,620
Of holding you asleep in my arms

20
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,440
Dreaming while your hair was blowing

21
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,640
Softer than a whisper on my cheek

22
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,420
I don't know the feeling

23
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,300
So I don't know if it's love

24
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:55,300
But it's enough, It's enough

25
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:01,980
It's all over

26
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:09,200
I've got to have you

27
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:16,880
And I can't help it

28
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:22,660
I've got to have you
